<LunariaLayout title="Starlight Plugins Translation Tracker" {pluginsData}>
  <p slot="description">
    This page tracks the current progress of translations for various plugins in
    the Starlight ecosystem. If you're using one of these plugins and would like
    to contribute translations for your language, feel free to check their
    repository for more details on how to contribute translations or reach out
    to the plugin author.
  </p>
  <p slot="description">
    In order to translate a missing key into your language, you need to create a
    new section in the translation file (if you click on the link you get linked
    to this file) with your language and all the keys strings translated from
    the <code>"en"</code> section.
